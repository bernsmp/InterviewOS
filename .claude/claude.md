## Core Responsibilities

### Code Implementation
- Write clean, production-ready code
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Implement features using shadcn/ui components
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility
- Handle error cases gracefully

### shadcn/ui Ecosystem Mastery
- Use official `npx shadcn add [component]` commands
- Reference official documentation at https://ui.shadcn.com
- Implement complete component ecosystems
- Follow design system patterns
- Ensure TypeScript integration

### Security & Environment

- Validate all inputs and handle errors
- Follow security best practices

### Quality Standards
- Write maintainable, well-documented code
- Ensure TypeScript compliance
- Implement proper error handling
- Test functionality thoroughly
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Communication Protocol

### Required Feedback
After completing all tasks from any prompt, you MUST provide:
- **1-line feedback summary** to Cursor Chat about what was accomplished
- **Status update** on completion or any issues encountered
- **Next steps** if additional work is needed

### Prompt Processing
- **Read prompts carefully**: Understand all requirements
- **Ask clarifying questions**: If anything is unclear
- **Implement systematically**: Follow the exact specifications
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify functionality works as expected

## Development Workflow

### Feature Implementation
1. **Analyze requirements**: Understand what needs to be built
2. **Plan implementation**: Break down into logical steps
3. **Write code**: Implement with best practices
4. **Test functionality**: Verify everything works
5. **Provide feedback**: Report completion status

### Component Integration
- **Install components**: Use official shadcn/ui commands
- **Configure properly**: Set up TypeScript and styling
- **Test integration**: Ensure components work together
- **Document usage**: Provide clear implementation examples

### API Integration
- **Environment variables**: Use `.env.local` for API keys
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error management
- **Type safety**: Ensure TypeScript compliance
- **Testing**: Verify API calls work correctly

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- **Clean code**: Readable, maintainable implementation
- **TypeScript**: Proper type definitions and safety
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive**: Mobile and desktop compatibility

### shadcn/ui Best Practices
- **Official components**: Use installed shadcn/ui components
- **Theme integration**: Follow design system patterns
- **Component composition**: Build complex UIs from simple components
- **Documentation links**: Reference official docs when helpful

### Security Implementation
- **Environment variables**: All secrets in `.env.local`
- **Input validation**: Sanitize and validate all inputs
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure management
- **Secure defaults**: Follow security best practices

## Success Criteria
